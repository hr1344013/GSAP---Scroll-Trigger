⚙️ How It Works

GSAP handles the animation timeline

ScrollTrigger monitors scroll position

Animations start, end, and scrub based on scroll progress

Elements animate when they enter or leave the viewport

Example animation behaviors:

Fade-in on scroll

Slide-up effects

Scale and rotate animations

Pinning sections during scroll
